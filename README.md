# DOPA workflow

This is repo for [DOPA](https://dopa.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en) workflow.

This repo provides the workflow for 

+  pre-processing of WDPA database and
+  computation of DOPA indicators

Preprocessing is aimed to prepare data to be subsequently used both for the preparation of [CEP](https://andreamandrici.github.io/dopa_workflow/flattening/) and for the computation of some of the indicators published in DOPA.


The following sections are currently present:

## Data sources

+  [Base Layers](./BaseLayers.md)


## Pre Processing

+  [WDPA](./wdpa_preprocessing/README.md)
+  [Themes](./raster_processing/README.md)


## Processing

### Computing Indicators ON [CEP](https://andreamandrici.github.io/dopa_workflow/flattening/)

+  [categorical rasters](./cep_analysis/#CATEGORICAL_RASTERS) --to be completed
+  [continuous rasters](./cep_analysis/#CONTINUOUS_RASTERS) --to be completed

### Other Indicators (non CEP)
+  [THDI](./wdpa_processing/#THDI) --to be written
+  [Pressures on buffers](./wdpa_processing/#Pressures) --to be written
